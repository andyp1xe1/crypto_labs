RIVERBANK PUBLICATION NO. 22, WRITTEN IN 1920 WHEN FRIEDMAN WAS28, MUST BE REGARDED AS THE MOSTIMPORTANT SINGLE PUBLICATION INCRYPTOLOGY. IT TOOK THE SCIENCE INTO A NEW WORLD. ENTITLEDTHE INDEX OFCOINCIDENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS IN CRYPTOGRAPHY, IT DESCRIBED THESOLUTIONOF TWO COMPLICATED CIPHER SYSTEMS. FRIEDMAN, HOWEVER, WAS LESSINTERESTED IN PROVING THEIRVULNERABILITY THAN HE WAS IN USING THEM AS AVEHICLE FOR NEW METHODS OF CRYPTANALYSIS.IN IT,FRIEDMAN DEVISED TWO NEW TECHNIQUES. ONE WAS BRILLIANT. ITPERMITTED HIM TO RECONSTRUCT APRIMARY CIPHER ALPHABET WITHOUT HAVINGTO GUESS AT A SINGLE PLAINTEXT LETTER. BUT THE OTHERWAS PROFOUND. FOR THEFIRST TIME IN CRYPTOLOGY, FRIEDMAN TREATED A FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION ASANENTITY, AS A CURVE WHOSE SEVERAL POINTS WERE CAUSALLY RELATED, NOT AS ZUSTA COLLECTION OFINDIVIDUAL LETTERS THAT HAPPEN TO STAND IN A CERTAIN ORDERFOR NONCAUSAL (HISTORICAL) REASONS,AND TO THIS CURVE HE APPLIED STATISTICALCONCEPTS. THE RESULTS CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED ASPROMETHEAN, FORFRIEDMAN'S STROKE OF GENIUS INSPIRED THE NUMEROUS, VARIED, ANDVITALSTATISTICAL TOOLS THAT ARE INDISPENSABLE TO THE CRYPTOLOGY OF TODAY.BEFORE FRIEDMAN,CRYPTOLOGY EKED OUT AN EXISTENCE AS A STUDY UNTOITSELF, AS AN ISOLATED PHENOMENON, NEITHERBORROWING FROM NORCONTRIBUTING TO OTHER BODIES OF KNOWLEDGE. FREQUENCY COUNTS,LINGUISTICCHARACTERISTICS, KASISKI EXAMINATIONS--ALL WERE PECULIAR AND PARTICULARTOCRYPTOLOGY. IT DWELT A RECLUSE IN THE WORLD OF SCIENCE. FRIEDMAN LEDCRYPTOLOGY OUT OF THISLONELY WILDERNESS AND INTO THE BROAD RICH DOMAIN OFSTATISTICS. HE CONNECTED CRYPTOLOGY TOMATHEMATICS. THE SENSE OFEXPANDING HORIJONS MUST HAVE RESEMBLED THAT FELT BY CHEMISTSWHENFRIEDRICH WOHLER SYNTHESIJED UREA, DEMONSTRATING THAT LIFE PROCESSESOPERATE UNDER WELL-KNOWN CHEMICAL LAWS AND ARE THEREFORE SUBZECT TOEXPERIMENTATION AND CONTROL, AND LEADING TOTODAY'S VAST STRIDES INBIOCHEMISTRY. WHEN FRIEDMAN SUBSUMED CRYPTANALYSIS UNDERSTATISTICS, HE LIKEWISE FLUNG WIDE THE DOOR TO ANARMAMENTARIUM TO WHICH CRYPTOLOGY HAD NEVERBEFORE HAD ACCESS. ITSWEAPONS--MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY AND DISPERSION, OF FITANDSKEWNESS, OF PROBABILITY AND SAMPLING AND SIGNIFICANCE--WERE IDEALLYFASHIONED TO DEAL WITHTHE STATISTICAL BEHAVIOR OF LETTERS AND WORDS.CRYPTANALYSTS, SEIJING THEM WITH ALACRITY,HAVE WIELDED THEM WITHNOTABLE SUCCESS EVER SINCE.THIS IS WHY FRIEDMAN HAS SAID, IN LOOKINGBACK OVER HIS CAREER, THATTHE INDEX OF COINCIDENCE WAS HIS GREATEST SINGLE CREATION. IT ALONEWOULDHAVE WON HIM HIS REPUTATION. BUT IN FACT IT WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING. HE AND MRS. FRIEDMANQUIT RIVERBANK NEAR THE END OF 1920. THESITUATION HAD BECOME INTOLERABLE. FABYAN HAD LURED HIMBACK AFTER THEWAR WITH RAISES AND PROMISES OF ABSOLUTE FREEDOM TO PROVE OR DISPROVETHEEXISTENCE OF CIPHERS IN SHAKESPEARE. BUT HE HAD SQUELCHED EVERYATTEMPT TO DO SO AND HADEMBARRASSED FRIEDMAN INTO APPARENTLYACQUIESCENT SILENCE AT LANTERN-SLIDE LECTURES ON THESUBZECT. ON ZANUARY1, 1921, FRIEDMAN BEGAN A SIX-MONTH CONTRACT WITH THE SIGNAL CORPSTODEVISE CRYPTOSYSTEMS. WHEN IT EXPIRED, HE WAS TAKEN ON THE CIVIL-SERVICEPAYROLL OF THE WARDEPARTMENT AT $4,500 A YEAR.ONE OF HIS FIRST ASSIGNMENTS WAS TO TEACH A COURSE IN MILITARYCODESAND CIPHERS AT THE SIGNAL SCHOOL, THEN AT CAMP ALFRED VAIL, NEW ZERSEY.FOR THIS HE WROTEA TEXTBOOK THAT, FOR THE FIRST TIME, IMPOSED ORDER UPONTHE CHAOS OF CIPHER SYSTEMS AND THEIRTERMINOLOGY. THESE HAD SPROUTEDIN A BEWILDERING VARIETY, AND WRITERS TREATED EACH AS INDIVIDUALANDSPECIAL CASES. FRIEDMAN SORTED THEM OUT ON THE BASIS OF STRUCTUREINSTEAD OF ASPECT, ANDSO LOGICAL AND USEFUL WAS THIS CLASSIFICATION THAT ITHAS BECOME STANDARD. HE MODELED HISNOMENCLATURE ON HIS CATEGORIES, SOTHAT THE NAMES HE MINTED HAVE THE GREAT MERIT OF MAKING THERELATIONSBETWEEN THE VARIOUS GENERA OF CIPHERS EVIDENT ON SIGHT. AN EXAMPLE ISTHECOMPLEMENTARY PAIR "MONO-ALPHABET" AND "POLYALPHABET"; THE FRENCHWERE STILL CALLINGPOLYALPHABETIC SYSTEMS BY THE ALMOST OBFUSCATORY"DOUBLE SUBSTITUTION," WHICH TELLSABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT THESYSTEM. FRIEDMAN'S MOST IMPORTANT COINAGE WAS THEWORD"CRYPTANALYSIS," WHICH HE DEVISED IN 1920 TO CLEAR UP A CHRONIC SOURCE OFCONFUSION INCRYPTOLOGY--THE AMBIGUITY OF THE VERB "DECIPHER," THEN USEDTO MEAN BOTH AUTHORIJED ANDUNAUTHORIJED REDUCTIONS OF A CRYPTOGRAM TO PLAINTEXT.HE TITLED HIS BOOK ELEMENTS OFCRYPTANALYSIS, AND THE TERM HAS SOPROSPERED THAT TODAY IT CIRCULATES IN GENERAL CONVERSATIONAND PRINT.
